      How can we successfully live on Mars? The essentials we will need to colonize Mars are the fundamentals that we as humans all need including: oxygen, clothing, water, shelter and food. Many private businesses, scientists, enginners and architects have been working towards ensuring we are a successful space-faring, multiplanetary species.

    MIT Michael Hecht, a principal investigator of the MOXIE instrument has found a way to make oxygen abundant on Mars. The MOXIE instrument or Mars Oxygen in situ Resource Utilization instrument is a reverse fuel cell. It will take in the Martian atmosphere and separate the carbon atom leaving us with pure oxygen. This process leaves us with 78% oxygen per CO2 molecule. NASA will send MOXIE with rovers to build replica MOXIEs that are 100 times bigger and have storage tanks. This huge MOXIE device will fill the storage tanks with liquid oxygen for us future landers. It will provided fuel to return to earth and keep colonizers alive on the planet.

    Mars has little atmospheric pressure so without a space suit, people will expand and look like the Michelan man. MIT scientist Dava Newman, pictured here, created a sleek and lightweight suit made from metallic fibers that will keep us together, block radiation, and keep us warm.

    The surface of Mars is dusty but contains up to 60% ice. The initial way we will get water to survive and thrive will be by using the WAVAR which was created by the University of Washington in 1998. WAVAR is a water vapor adsorption reactor that is meant to act like a dehumidifyer extracting water from the atmosphere of Mars. At night the cooling of Mars produces 100% humidity which allows us to extract plenty of water to allow for colonizing Mars.

    Mars has little to no atmospheric pressure, it is cold, has no oxygen and high radiation. Now this all sounds like a difficult feat to cross but NASA engineers and architect Bjarka Ingels have created ways to create Mars shelters that contend with these issues. Partially underground dome designs descend into the Martian soil offering increase protection from these issues we could encounter. There are other ways we can engineer shelters after we have colonized like 3D printed building from the Martian soil mixed with polymers.

    <p>
      How will we get food? Our plan is to use hydroponics and aeroponics to grow some of our food on Mars but this is tricky in a greenhouse. Since it can be tricky our goal is to use these systems to give us 20% of our caloric intake. The other 80% of our intake will be from dried foods from Earth until we can make liquid water flow and grow crops outside.
